    <h2 style="font-weight: 300; margin-bottom: 60px;">As you can see from the differences between these photos, plants can easily become unhealthy and diseased. This semester, we studied microbes that can cause these diseases.</h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Microbes can be found almost anywhere in the world. This semester, we got the chance to nurture a microbe and test it in a variety of conditions.
        I isolated my microbe from a culture grown during the "Microbes are Everywhere" experiment. My microbe was a bacteria taken from
        microbes that grew in a culture isolated from a window in my apartment. This bacteria was orange at the time of isolation, and looked like a slimy, raised substance.<br/><br/>
        In these following experiments, the pet bacteria was tested to learn more about the biology of the organism and the conditions in which it thrived or struggled.
        The experiments were formed to answer the following questions about the bacteria: 1) does the bacteria survive in freezing temperatures, 2) does the bacteria adapt and grow in a chrome agar nutrient, 3) can the bacteria survive and grown in a healthy leaf, and 4) what is the relationship the bacteria has with another microbe?
    </p>

    <h2>Experiment 1: Environment the bacteria will grown in</h2>
    <h3><b>Hypothesis: </b>The bacteria will not grow in freezing temperatures, because the temperature will create an unhospitable environment for the microbe to reproduce</h3>
    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Results:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>Experiment 2: Nutrient that the bacteria will grow on</h2>
    <h3><b>Hypothesis: </b>The bacteria will grow on the chrome agar but not the water agar, as the chrome agar provides adequate nutrients for the bacteria, but the water does not provide enough sustainble nutrients for the bacteria to reproduce</h3>
    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Results:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>Experiment 3: Growth in a living organism</h2>
    <h3><b>Hypothesis:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Results:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>Experiment 4: Interaction with another microbe</h2>
    <h3><b>Hypothesis:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Description:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Results:</b></h3>
    <h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
